    <h1>Tips for Financial Cybersecurity</h1>
    <ol class="section">
      <h2><li>Keep Your Devices Updated</li></h2>
      <p>
        Always use antivirus software and make sure your computer, browser, and
        apps are up to date. Set them to update automatically to stay protected
        against new threats.
      </p>
      <h2><li>Use Strong and Unique Passwords</li></h2>
      <p>
        Create long passwords (at least 10 characters) with a mix of letters,
        numbers, and symbols. Avoid using the same password for multiple
        accounts. Use a password manager to safely store and manage them.
      </p>
      <h2><li>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</li></h2>
      <p>
        Add an extra layer of security by using two-factor authentication. This
        could be a code sent to your phone or fingerprint login. Even if someone
        gets your password, 2FA can block them.
      </p>
      <h2><li>Think Before You Click</li></h2>
      <p>
        Don’t click on links or attachments in emails or texts unless you're
        sure they're safe. Scammers often pretend to be your bank or a trusted
        company to trick you into sharing personal information.
      </p>
      <h2><li>Protect Your Personal Info</li></h2>
      <p>
        Treat your personal data like cash. Don’t give out your Social Security
        number, account numbers, or passwords unless you’re sure who you’re
        dealing with. Be cautious with unexpected calls, texts, or emails.
      </p>
      <h2><li>Monitor Your Accounts Regularly</li></h2>
      <p>
        Check your bank and credit card statements often. Watch for any charges
        or changes you don’t recognize. Sign up for alerts from your bank for
        added protection.
      </p>
      <h2><li>Back Up Your Files</li></h2>
      <p>
        Keep copies of important documents and files on an external hard drive
        or secure cloud storage. If something happens to your computer, you
        won’t lose everything.
      </p>
      <h2><li>Report Suspicious Activity Immediately</li></h2>
      <p>
        If you notice anything strange—unauthorized transactions, password
        changes, or missing emails—contact your bank right away. Fast action can
        prevent further damage.
